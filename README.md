# 🐄 Cattle Health Analysis — ML Web App

A machine learning web application that predicts cattle diseases based on **body temperature** and **pulse rate** using a Decision Tree Classifier. Built with Flask and scikit-learn.

---

## 📌 Features

- Upload a CSV dataset to train the ML model
- Predict cattle disease based on temperature and pulse input
- Displays precautionary measures for the predicted disease
- Simple and clean web interface

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning

- **Algorithm:** Decision Tree Classifier (scikit-learn)
- **Input Features:** Temperature, Pulse
- **Output:** Predicted Disease + Precaution Message

### Diseases Detected
| Disease | Precaution |
|---|---|
| Severe Heat Stress | Immediate cooling; consult a vet |
| Moderate Heat Stress | Provide shade and hydration |
| Mild Heat Stress | Rest in a cool area |
| Possible Viral Infection | Monitor; consult vet if worsens |
| Bradycardia | Monitor; consult vet if persists |
| Hypothermia / Severe Hypothermia | Provide warmth; immediate vet help |
| Possible Bacterial Infection | Consult a veterinarian |
| Hyperthermia | Immediate cooling required |
| Severe Tachycardia | Monitor closely |
| Healthy | No precautions needed |
